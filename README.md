## Repository Structure

## Introduction
Streaming a 4k virtual reality (VR) video requires about 600 Mbit/s internet speed connection. The average user does not have access to these speeds. Our proposed solution was to adaptively render each frame of a VR video based on where users are looking. This would ideally reduce file size while having no impact on a user's experience.

### Hypothesis
If we discard areas from the frame that are not seen by the user and compress remaining areas based on relative values of importance, viewers will notice a negligible loss of quality of experience while significantly reducing file size.
